## Summary
I am a Computer Systems Engineer with a start in the tech industry as a Junior Backend Developer in 2020. Specializing in .Net and C# development, I've deployed services on Azure and developed frontends using React and TypeScript. My recent work involves leveraging AI to enhance recruitment processes, along with significant experience in GPS tracking system architecture using Kubernetes on Azure.

## Professional Experience

### Koble (Startup)
**Full Stack Developer**  
2023 - Present
- Developed and maintained GraphQL identity servers and APIs.
- Collaborated on AI testing and deployment to Azure for matching students with recruiters.

### Resser
**Systems Architect / Developer**  
2020 - 2023

#### 2020-2021:
- Dedicated a year to developing on the .NET Framework 4.5, maintaining the GPS server, website API, and worker processes.
- Designed and implemented a new parser for an upgraded GPS model, handling data such as position (latitude/longitude), timestamp, device ID, battery status, speed, and direction, using TCP communications.
- Developed a user dashboard from scratch, including the design and backend implementations. Created robust API endpoints and complex SQL queries to handle large data sets, enabling users to retrieve up to a month's data, accommodating scenarios with approximately 200,000 positions per day per user.
- Significantly optimized a critical system worker that managed geofence entry and exit checks for vehicles; reduced average processing time from 30 seconds to 300 milliseconds by redesigning the algorithm and improving data handling efficiency, ensuring comprehensive processing of position data.

#### 2021-2023:
- Rebuilt the GPS server on .NET 6, adopting a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and reliability:
    - Utilized Event Hub to manage 5-7 million messages per day.
    - Employed Kubernetes for orchestrating microservices involved in parsing, saving messages, processing alerts, and calculating georeferences (street names, city, state, and country names).
    - Used Docker to create and manage images for all microservices.
    - Developed APIs for frontend requests and Websockets for real-time vehicle positioning, report generation, and new vehicle alerts.
- Contributed to frontend development, employing React with TypeScript and the Ant Design (AntD) library for UI components.
