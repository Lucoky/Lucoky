## Professional Experience

### Koble (Startup)
**Full Stack Developer**  
2023 - Present
- Spearheaded the development of a versatile Identity Server supporting multiple users, integrated with Google authentication.
- Engineered a comprehensive GraphQL API for handling all frontend queries and mutations, configured with conditional authentication based on the request type.
- Developed a worker for data processing using Azure Functions on .NET 6, enhancing backend efficiency and scalability.
- Assisted in creating a Docker Compose setup for local environments; this configuration deploys a local Azure storage account and PostgreSQL, designed to facilitate easy and secure testing for developers.

### Resser
**Systems Architect / Developer**  
2020 - 2023

#### 2020-2021:
- Dedicated a year to developing on the .NET Framework 4.5, maintaining the GPS server, website API, and worker processes.
- Designed and implemented a new parser for an upgraded GPS model, handling data such as position (latitude/longitude), timestamp, device ID, battery status, speed, and direction, using TCP communications.
- Developed a user dashboard from scratch, including the design and backend implementations. Created robust API endpoints and complex SQL queries to handle large data sets, enabling users to retrieve up to a month's data, accommodating scenarios with approximately 200,000 positions per day per user.
- Significantly optimized a critical system worker that managed geofence entry and exit checks for vehicles; reduced average processing time from 30 seconds to 300 milliseconds by redesigning the algorithm and improving data handling efficiency, ensuring comprehensive processing of position data.

#### 2021-2023:
- Rebuilt the GPS server on .NET 6, adopting a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and reliability:
    - Utilized Event Hub to manage 5-7 million messages per day.
    - Employed Kubernetes for orchestrating microservices involved in parsing, saving messages, processing alerts, and calculating georeferences (street names, city, state, and country names).
    - Used Docker to create and manage images for all microservices.
    - Developed APIs for frontend requests and Websockets for real-time vehicle positioning, report generation, and new vehicle alerts.
- Contributed to frontend development, employing React with TypeScript and the Ant Design (AntD) library for UI components.
